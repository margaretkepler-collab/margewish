    "text": "Welcome to my Birthday/Christmas wishlist website for the 2025 celebration season. Be sure to read all announcements on his home page, or else, you’re lame.\nA couple ground rules to lay out. These can be either suggestions or inspirations. If you wish to take these as inspirations, and go on your merry creative way. Go ahead! If your name is Michael Kepler and you have a hard time expressing creativity during the Christmas festivities and can only provide athlectic gummies or stolen packages as presents, then you may take these as ideas if you so may wish.\nFor Mom and Dad to read: I do not expect much from either of you this year! You are already providing enough for me this year, so if you would look through this and pick one item out that is absolutely perfect! But I don’t want you to think this is all needed, as you have already given me everything I would ever need this year! #much love\nFor Michael: guh\nFor Mom-mom: Use this as ideas becuase I know you get stressed about picking things out! There are many different taps for each category of present, so use this as much as you want!\nFor Nick:\n\n\n\nnhehehe\n\n\nHappy reading through!\nMuch love, Margaret"

Been really into color tho, if you need any advice go to Nicholas as he is subjected to hearing and seeing every piece of clothing I even remotely fancy so if you need an opinion on an item for me, send him a picture he knows the answer\nThere are some nice long sleeves at zara, kind of a wider neck kind of look which was nice (makes my broad/so muscular shoulders look less big, can be applied to sweater too) but there was a nice green colored long sleeve that was cute\nCute colors, unique, idk cute things I been loving!"
